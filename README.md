## ðŸ’»Counter Project

This is my first Javascript Project:

Let's make a simple application that works like a counter.

![Counter application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101564006/163707238-3457b4d2-e2c1-417f-837d-74d64025261d.png)

 Develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase and decrease the value of the counter. As soon as the user enters the page, he will see 0 as the value of the counter and will have two buttons +/- to change the value of the counter.
